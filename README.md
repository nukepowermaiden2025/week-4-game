# Gems Collector Game
This is a simple game that is served in the browser and is meant to demonstrate compentency with jquery library. The game dynamically generates gems with random numbers and also another random number is generated. The gems have certain values randomly assigned to them that are hidden from the user. The player is meant to reduce the randomly generated number to zero without going negative based on the value of the gems values. It is a fun way to pass the time. See the link below. Good luck!
